# FunnyDeathMessages

A simple Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot plugin to replace default death messages with silly versions (MCv1.11.2).

Edit the messages.yml file to customize the death messages.

The plugin has no dependencies and will likely have no effect on any other plugins already installed! Always back-up to be sure, though.

Any forks, branches, and pull requests are welcome! Please feel free to voice criticism to better the project, as well.
