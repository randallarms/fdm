A simple Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot plugin to replace default death messages with silly versions (MCv1.11.2).

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/funnydeathmessages.211909/

The plugin has no dependencies and will likely have no effect on any other plugins already installed! Always back-up to be sure, though.

Any forks, branches, and pull requests are welcome! Please feel free to voice criticism to better the project, as well.
